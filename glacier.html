              <p>In the heart of Montana, right at the Canadian border, lies the gorgeous Glacier National Park filled with magnificent mountains, the glamorous glaciers and lustrous lakes.</p>

              <h3>Day 1: Spokane</h3>
              <p>We flew into Spokane (~5 hours from the park) on the night of July 4th, 2019. We stayed the night there and started for the park the next morning.</p>

              <h3>Day 2: West Glacier</h3>
              <p>Around 1pm, we reached the west end of Lake MacDonald.</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/lake_mcdonald.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Lake McDonald</div>
              <p>We grabbed a bite at the nearby Eddie’s cafe and headed out east along the Going to the Sun road. It’s hard not to stop at every lookout point along Lake MacDonald, which itself is a tiny part of the park! We stopped at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/48%C2%B036'34.9%22N+113%C2%B052'56.5%22W/@48.6094767,-113.8838638,18.84z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d48.6096972!4d-113.88235">one</a>, to take pictures.</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/lake_mcdonald_drive.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Lake McDonald</div>
              <p>Our next stop was the Lake McDonald lodge (we weren’t able to book lodging here). The lodge has a rustic feel and has a private entrance to the lake. There are some food options here as well. We ate at Jammer Joe’s and headed onwards.</p>
              <p>Once past the lake, we were greeted by the gushing whitewaters of the McDonald creek. The turquoise waters with the lush background made for some beautiful pictures.</p>

              <div class="image_title"><a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=loc:48.6558389,-113.8402694">Far end of John’s lake trail</a></div>
              <p>Next, we drove past the weeping wall, which had a rather magical background</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/weeping.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Approaching the Weeping Wall</div>
              <p>Right opposite the weeping wall are beautiful meadows with views of the hanging valley</p>
              <!-- <img src="images/glacier/hanging.jpeg" /> -->
              <img src="images/glacier/meadow.jpeg" />
              <p>Up next was the hike we actually wanted to complete that day, the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2515851156">Hidden Lake Overlook</a>. We reached the Logan pass visitor center around 9 pm and started out on a brisk hike while there was still some daylight. The views here, like everywhere else in this park, were mystical.</p>

              <div class="image_title">Hike to Hidden Lake Overlook</div>
              <p>It got a bit chilly and parts of the trail were icy</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/icy.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Hike to Hidden Lake Overlook</div>
              <p>But we made it to the end!</p>

              <h3>Day 3: Logan Pass and Swiftcurrent Trail</h3>
              <p>We reached Logan pass visitor center ~10am and wanted to hike (part of) the Highline trail. But unfortunately the parking lot was full :(</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/logan.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Logan Pass</div>
              <p>So we took a few pictures and drove further eastwards. We made a stop at Saint Mary Lake before exiting the park from the east exit.</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/mary.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Saint Mary Lake</div>
              <p>For lunch, we were extremely fortunate to find this restaurant named <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/a8C3xYDnfADbeWFH8">Johnson’s</a>. They had the most amazing sandwiches and their huckleberry ice-cream is not to be missed!</p>

              <div class="image_title">Huckleberry Ice-cream at Johnson’s</div>
              <h4>Entering Many Glacier</h4>
              <p>Post lunch we headed to the Many Glacier area and things got dramatically more exciting here. Around 3pm, we checked into our cozy Historic Cabin at the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn. This is a cheaper alternative to the nearby Many Glacier Hotel and is right at the Swiftcurrent trailhead and has a more camping-like feel (no private bath for instance).</p>
              <h4>Swiftcurrent Trail</h4>
              <p>Without much further ado, we headed out to hike the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2515851255">Swiftcurrent trail</a>. The experience of hiking amid alpine lakes and flora against a background of glaciers is quite surreal.</p>

              <div class="image_title">Swiftcurrent Trail</div>
              <img src="images/glacier/redrock.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/MwmTWf6tjgjFmGUZ7">Redrock Falls</a></div>
              <p>A couple hours into the hike the weather took a sudden turn from sunny to thunderstorm so we turned around at the Bullhead Lake.</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/bullhead.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Bullhead Lake</div>
              <p>For dinner, we headed to the (quite fancy!) restaurant at the Many Glacier Hotel.</p>

              <h3>Day 4: Iceberg lake trail</h3>
              <p>On the last day we chose to hike the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2515851276">Iceberg Lake Trail</a> (we wanted to do the Grinnell Glacier hike as well but we had time for just one, so that’s for next time :-) ). This was a gorgeous hike filled with majestic views and wildflowers.</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/iceberg_trail_1.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Iceberg Lake Trail</div>
              <p>The lake itself is a perfect glacial blue and made for a perfect lunch spot before the hike back.</p>
              <img src="images/glacier/iceberg_lake.jpeg" />
              <div class="image_title">Iceberg Lake</div>
              <p>After the hike, we rented a paddle boat and spent an hour paddling the calm waters of the Swiftcurrent lake, still mesmerized by the beauty of this miraculous park.</p>
